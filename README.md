# Cursor Rules Repository

This repository contains a collection of rule definitions for the Cursor IDE to enforce code conventions and architectural guidelines across different programming languages and project styles.

## What's Inside

- **typescript-clean/** - Rules for TypeScript projects following clean architecture principles
- **rust/** - Rules for Rust projects with idiomatic patterns and best practices

Each directory contains its own README with detailed explanations of the rule categories and specific guidelines.

## Usage

Place these rules under `.cursor/rules` in your project to have them automatically enforced by the Cursor IDE. 

For agent-specific guidance, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for instructions to AI coding assistants working in this repository.
