### New feature:

- follow the rules in @.cursor  and finish the implementation of @002-static-html-generation.md . keep doing small increamental TDD steps until all the features are implemented and all the tests pass. Always write a test first. commit your work when new tests pass. update the spec with progress. never test the domain layer directly.


### Refactoring:

- refer to the @simplicity.mdc @idiomatic_rust.mdc @functional_approach.mdc and inspect the existing @api and @domain - make a plan for improvements and refactoring

- write a new spec according to the plan for the refactoring in code-refactoring.md

- follow the rules in @.cursor  and start the implementation of @code-refactoring.md . refactor in small steps and run the tests often. Don't write ANY NEW TESTS! Don't change any tests in a way that circumvents asserts! commit your work after each refactoring step when the tests pass. update the spec with progress.
