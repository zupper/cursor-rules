# MDC Rules Location

## Description
This meta rule ensures that all new MDC (Model-Driven Code) rules are created in the `.cursor/rules` directory, maintaining a consistent and organized structure for rule management.

<rule>
name: mdc_location_rule

    message: |
      Please ensure all MDC rule files are:
      1. Placed in the `.cursor/rules/{category}/` directory
      2. Organized by their functional category (meta, workflow, architecture, patterns, project)
      3. Named descriptively with the `.mdc` extension
      4. Follow the proper rule structure format
</rule>

## Rule
When creating new MDC rules:
1. All new MDC rules MUST be created in the `.cursor/rules/{category}/` directory
2. Each rule MUST be in a separate file
3. Rule files MUST use the `.mdc` extension
4. Rule files MUST follow the naming convention: `[rule-name].mdc`
5. Rule files MUST contain proper markdown formatting

## Implementation
- The Cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:
  - Automatically creating new MDC rules in the appropriate `.cursor/rules/{category}/` directory
  - Preventing creation of MDC rules outside this directory structure
  - Maintaining separation of rules into individual files
  - Ensuring proper file extensions and naming conventions

## Benefits
- Improved organization and maintainability
- Easier rule discovery and management
- Consistent rule structure across the project
- Better version control and tracking of rule changes

## Examples
✅ Correct:
```
.cursor/rules/
  ├── meta/
  │   ├── mdc-rules-location.mdc
  │   └── mdc-rules-structure.mdc
  ├── workflow/
  │   └── specs-structure.mdc
  ├── architecture/
  │   └── dependency-inversion.mdc
  └── patterns/
      └── naming-convention.mdc
```

❌ Incorrect:
```
.cursor/
  ├── rules/
  │   └── random-rule.mdc
  └── other-rules/
      └── another-rule.mdc
